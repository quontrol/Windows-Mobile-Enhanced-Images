These are the source images I used to recreate the Pocket PC 2003 Bliss image.

There are 2 flag images, one with a shadow, one without.

The background image was cropped from the Bliss 600 DPI image (https://archive.org/details/bliss-600dpi)

The original image is included as well (and converted to PNG)
